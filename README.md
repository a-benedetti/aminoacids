This tool is a simple and intuitive amino acid table, made for students and anyone else who wants to have this information around while working with proteins. Visit and try out  [the current prototype](https://a-benedetti.github.io/aminoacids/) on github pages, and feel free to let me know what functionalities you'd like to see next!

### Coming soon:
- table can be ordered and filtered based on amino acid properties
- 3D amin oacid viewer
